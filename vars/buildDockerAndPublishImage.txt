    The following arguments are available for this function:
    <ul>
      <li>String imageName: (Mandatory) name of the image to built, usually referenced as the "Repository" part of a Docker image's name without any tag (Example: "builder" or "terraform").</li>
      <li>Map config: (Optionnal) custom configuration for the image build an deploy process. The maps can holds any of the following keys:
        <ul>
          <li>String registry: (Optional, defaults to "registry-1.docker.io/jenkinsciinfra") Registry reference of the Docker image to be published. It might contains hostname, port and "namespace".
          (Valid examples: "jenkinsci", "registry.quay.io/jenkins-beta", "10.0.2.15:8080/admin").</li>
          <li>String mainBranch: (Optional, defaults to "master") Name of the git's principal branch used to trigger deploy of the "latest" tag (Example: "main").</li>
          <li>String dockerfile: (Optional, defaults to "Dockerfile") Relative path to the Dockerfile to use within the repository's context (Example: "build.dockerfile", "docker/Dockerfile").</li>
          <li>String credentials: (Optional, defaults to "jenkins-dockerhub") Name of the Jenkins'credentials used to authenticate on the Docker remote registry during the full build process. (Example: "internal-registry-credential").</li>

    <p>
    The Lint phase generates a report when it fails, recorded by the hadolint tool in your Jenkins instance.
    </p>

    <p>
    The build phase adds a bunch of build args that you can use in your Dockerfile:
    <ul>
      <li>GIT_COMMIT_REV - The commit that triggered this build</li>
      <li>GIT_SCM_URL - Url to repo </li>
      <li>BUILD_DATE - Date that the image was built (now) </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    The test phase is only executed if a file `cst.yml` is found at the root of the repository with the "TAR" driver for security concerns.

    </p>

    <p>
    Publication of the Docker Image only happens when the build is triggered by:
    <ul>
      <li>A push event on the repository's principal branch referenced by "config.mainBranch".</li>
      <li>A tag event on the repository.</li>
    </ul>
