= Jenkins Infra's Docker Tooling

This page describes the generic instructions to build and verify the Docker images
used by the Jenkins Infrastructure project.

By "generic", we mean to have the same process and tooling reused for each image to provide:

- Easier contribution and onboarding
- Build reproductibility between contributor machines and CI environment
- Best practises applied, including conventions, security patterns, standarized metadatas and optimized images
- Try to leverage build security as much as possible

== Quick Start

* Ensure that you have the correct <<Requirements>> installed
** If you have Docker installed and ready, please look at the section <<Using Docker>> first

* Clone the repository hosting the source code of the Docker Image to build and position your command line inside this repository
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone <URL of the repository docker-something>
cd ./docker-something/
----

* Retrieve the `Makefile` located in the same directory as this documentation somewhere on your machine.
It can be stored in your repository but you should git-ignore it.
** Example using the `curl` command line:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Download the Makefile. You might need to adapt the URL.
curl -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/master/resources/io/jenkins/infra/docker/Makefile" -O
# Ensure that Makefile is git-ignored
grep 'Makefile' .gitignore || echo 'Makefile' | tee -a .gitignore
----

* Execute the "developer" workflow with the command `make all`
** Or `CONTAINER_BIN=docker make all` if you have Docker
** And/or `make -C <Path to the directory containing your Makefile> all`


== Requirements

* Command prompt with bash (or zsh/ksh)

* GNU Make 3.81+ command line

* A https://github.com/moby/buildkit[Buildkit] compliant container tool
** The command line top use is defined by the value of the environment variable `CONTAINER_BIN` which defauls to `img`
** Our pipelines are using (Jessie Frazelle's) https://github.com/genuinetools/img[`genuinetools/img`] command line in v0.5.11, for security purposes (container in containers)
** You can use https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker v20.10+] and its command line instead, by setting `CONTAINER_BIN` to `docker`

* https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test[Google's Container Structure Test] command line in v1.9.1+

* https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/releases[hadolint] for Dockerfile static checks

=== Using Docker

* Export the variable once in the current terminal, and then run make commands:
+
[source,bash]
---
export CONTAINER_BIN=docker
# ...
make lint
make build
# ...
----

* OR prefix make commands with `CONTAINER_BIN=docker`:

[source,bash]
---
CONTAINER_BIN=docker make lint
CONTAINER_BIN=docker make build
----

== Workflow Steps

The following steps are available:

* Linting with `make lint` to run a static analyzis to ensure good practises are applied the written code.

* Build the image with `make build` to generate a local TAR archive in `image.tar`
and store it in the local container tool's index under the name defined by `$IMAGE_NAME` (see <<Customization>>).
** You might want to authenticated your container tool to the Docker Hub to avoid rate limitation for this step.

* Run a test harness with the command `make test`, on the image stored in `image.tar`.

* Cleanup the image and its generated artefacts with `make clean`.

* Execute the "developer workflow" with `make all`, which executes (in this order) `make clean lint build test`.

* Deploy the image with `make deploy` to tag the current image referenced by `$IMAGE_NAME` as `$IMAGE_DEPLOY_NAME`
(see <<Customization>>) and then push it to the remote repository implied by `$IMAGE_DEPLOY_NAME`.
** This steps requires the container tool to be authenticated to the remote registry.
** This step is NOT part of the standard workflow and should only be executed by the CI/CD system.

== Customization

You can customize the different steps through the following environment variables:

* `IMAGE_NAME` (Defaults to `helloworld`): name of the image built on the local container tool.
* `IMAGE_DEPLOY_NAME` (Defaults to the same value as `IMAGE_NAME`): final name of the image to be pushed to a remote Docker registry service (ideally after the test harness success to avoid dangling and untested artefacts).
* `DOCKERFILE` (Defaults to `Dockerfile`): the relative path to the Dockerfile to be built under the current ($(PWD)) context directory.
* `IMAGE_ARCHIVE` (Defaults to `image.tar`): the path to the TAR archive continaining the docker image.
* `CONTAINER_BIN` (Defaults to `img`): The container's command line tool to use for building and deploying the image.
* The "metadata" informations passed as both labels and arguments to the build:
** `GIT_COMMIT_REV` (Defaults to current commit's SHA): Git reference of the Docker image's code.
** `GIT_SCM_URL` (Defaults to the URL of the current git's remote named "origin"): URL of the git SCM repository's remote of the Docker image's code.
** `SCM_URI` (Defaults from `GIT_SCM_URL` value): HTTPS (enforced) URL of `GIT_SCM_URL`.
** `BUILD_DATE` (Default to "now" when called): UTC timestamp formatted in `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S` when the command occurs.

You can check the file `Makefile` if you want to get a better deep-dive understanding.


== Contributing

* Contributing to this documentation or tooling must follow the contribution rules of this repository (please check link:../../../../../README.adoc#Contributing[])

* Start by writing an issue in link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues[the Jenkins Infrastructure help desk], and take time to describe the problem you want to solve:
** Why do you need it?
** Is it an unexpected behavior? Or is it a new behavior you envision?
** Any contextual information explaining your proposal

* Then you can proceed to a Github's Pull Request "classic" workflow described in their documentation at link:https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests[]:
** Fork the repository
** Add the code changes (which should include related documentation)
** Ensure that the test harnesses are working correctly
** Open a Pull request referencing the help desk issue you've created earlier to help reviewers
