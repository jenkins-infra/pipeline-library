This repository contains a series of steps and variables for use inside of the
Jenkins project's own link:https://ci.jenkins.io[Jenkins] instance(s).

Check link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation/blob/master/ci.adoc[this description] of available services.

== Useful steps:

=== buildPlugin

WARNING: Gradle support in `buildPlugin()` is deprecated and will be eventually removed. Please use `buildPluginWithGradle()`

Applies the appropriate defaults for building a Maven-based plugin project on
Linux and Windows.

You are advised to be using a link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom/blob/master/README.md[2.x parent POM].

.Jenkinsfile
[source,groovy]
----
buildPlugin()
----

==== Optional arguments

* `repo` (default: `null`  inherit from Multibranch) - custom Git repository to check out
* `useContainerAgent` (default: `false`) - uses a link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation/blob/main/ci.adoc#container-agents[Container agent] instead of a Virtual Machine: usually faster to start and generates less costs for the project
** Please note that the implementation of "containers" can be changed over time
* `useAci` (DEPRECATED - see `useContainerAgent`)
* `failFast` (default: `true`) - instruct Maven tests to fail fast
* `platforms` (default: `['linux', 'windows']`) - Labels matching platforms to
  execute the steps against in parallel
* `jdkVersions` (default: `[8]`) - JDK version numbers, must match a version
  number jdk tool installed
* `jenkinsVersions`: (default: `[null]`) - a matrix of Jenkins baseline versions to build/test against in parallel (null means default,
  only available for Maven projects)
* `configurations`: An alternative way to specify `platforms`, `jdkVersions` and `jenkinsVersions` (that can not be combined
  with any of them).
* `artifactCachingProxyEnabled`: (default: `false`) - if set to `true`, artifacts will be downloaded using one of the artifact caching proxy depending on the agent provider (Azure, DigitalOcean or AWS).

** Those options will run the build for all combinations of their values. While that is desirable in
  many cases, `configurations` permit to provide a specific combinations of label and java/jenkins versions to use
+
[source,groovy]
----
buildPlugin(/*...*/, configurations: [
  [ platform: "linux", jdk: "8", jenkins: null ],
  [ platform: "windows", jdk: "8", jenkins: null ],
  [ platform: "linux", jdk: "11", jenkins: "2.150" ]
])
----

* `tests`: (default: `null`) - a map of parameters to run tests during the build. The test results and the JaCoCo code
coverage results are recorded after the build with the corresponding Jenkins plugins.
** `skip` - If `true`, skip all the tests by setting the `-skipTests` profile.
  It will also skip FindBugs in modern Plugin POMs.
* `spotbugs`, `checkstyle`, `pmd`, `cpd`: (default: `null`) - a map of parameters to archive SpotBugs, CheckStyle, PMD, or CPD warnings, respectively (only available for Maven projects).
These values can replace or amend the default configuration for the `recordIssues` step of the https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin[Warnings NG Plugin].
See https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/master/doc/Documentation.md#configuration[Warnings NG Plugin documentation]
for a list of available configuration parameters.
* `timeout`: (default: `60`) - the number of minutes for build timeout, cannot be bigger than 180, i.e. 3 hours.

NOTE: The `recordIssues` steps of the warnings plugin run on the first platform/jdkVersion,jenkinsVersion combination only.
So in the example below it will run for `linux`/`jdk7` but not on `jdk8`.

Usage:

.Jenkinsfile
[source,groovy]
----
buildPlugin(platforms: ['linux'],
        jdkVersions: [7, 8],
        checkstyle: [qualityGates: [[threshold: 1, type: 'NEW', unstable: true]]],
        pmd: [trendChartType: 'TOOLS_ONLY', qualityGates: [[threshold: 1, type: 'NEW', unstable: true]]])
----

=== buildPluginWithGradle()

Builds a Jenkins plugin using Gradle.
The implementation follows the standard build/test/archive pattern.
The method targets compatibility with link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-jpi-plugin[Gradle JPI Plugin],
and it may not work for other use-cases.

==== Optional arguments

* `repo` (default: `null`  inherit from Multibranch) - custom Git repository to check out
* `failFast` (default: `true`) - instruct the build to fail fast when one of the configurations fail
* `platforms` (default: `['linux', 'windows']`) - Labels matching platforms to
  execute the steps against in parallel
* `jdkVersions` (default: `[8]`) - JDK version numbers, must match a version
  number jdk tool installed
* `configurations`: An alternative way to specify `platforms`, `jdkVersions` (that can not be combined
  with any of them)
** Those options will run the build for all combinations of their values. While that is desirable in
  many cases, `configurations` permit to provide a specific combinations of label and java/jenkins versions to use
+
[source,groovy]
----
buildPluginWithGradle(/*...*/, configurations: [
  [ platform: "linux", jdk: "8" ],
  [ platform: "windows", jdk: "8"],
])
----

* `tests`: (default: `null`) - a map of parameters to run tests during the build
** `skip` - If `true`, skip all the tests.
* `timeout`: (default: `60`) - the number of minutes for build timeout, cannot be bigger than 180, i.e. 3 hours.

==== Limitations

Not all features of `buildPlugin()` for Maven are supported in the gradle flow.
Examples of not supported features:

* Deployment of incremental versions (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/305[JEP-305])
* Publishing of static analysis and coverage reports (Checkstyle, SpotBugs, JaCoCo)
* Configuring `jenkinsVersion` for the build flow (as standalone arguments or as `configurations`)
* Usage of link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/[Azure Container Instances] as agents (only Maven agents are configured)

=== infra.isTrusted()

Determine whether the Pipeline is executing in an internal "trusted" Jenkins
environment

.Jenkinsfile
[source,groovy]
----
if (infra.isTrusted()) {
    /* perform some trusted action like a deployment */
}
----

=== infra.ensureInNode(nodeLabels, body)

Ensures that the given code block is runs in a node with the specified labels

.Jenkinsfile
[source,groovy]
----
infra.ensureInNode('docker,java') {
    sh 'docker -v'
}
----

=== infra.stashJenkinsWar(jenkins, stashName)

Given a version of jenkins downloads it if necessary and stashes it under the given name (which defaults to "jenkinsWar",
see the step doc for more documentation about he allowed versions

.Jenkinsfile
[source,groovy]
----
infra.stashJenkinsWar("2.110")
----

=== runATH

Runs the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness[Acceptance Test Harness] in a configurable way.

The configuration is divided into two parts, one related to the step itself and another related to how the ATH is run.
To configure the step just use the step's parameters described below, to configure the ATH runs a metadata file (in YAML format)
is used. Further sections describe the metadata file in detail. *Note that if the metadata file does not exist this step
will do nothing at all.*

The list of step's params and the related default values are:


`athUrl`::
 The URL to get the ATH sources. It can point to a local path (by using the file:// protocol) or a github destination. Defaults to https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness.git. *Can be overridden from the metadata file*
`athRevision`::
The ATH revision to use, can be a branch or tag name or a commit id. Defaults to branch master. *Can be overridden from the metadata file*
`athImage` ::
The docker image used for the environment where to run the ATH. Defaults to "jenkins/ath". Use "local" to build the image directly from the ATH sources. *Can be overridden from the metadata file*
`metadataFile`::
 A String indicating the file path (relative to where this step is executed) to use as metadata file for the build, more details about the metadata file are provided belows. *Defaults to `essentials.yml` at the location where this step is invoked*
`jenkins`::
 URI to the jenkins.war, Jenkins version or one of "latest", "latest-rc", "lts" and "lts-rc". Defaults to "latest". For local war files use the file:// protocol in the URI. *Can be overridden from the metadata file*
 `jdks`::
 Java versions to use when running ATH. Defaults to 8. Only 8 and 11 are supported. *Can be overridden from the metadata file*
`configFile`::
 (Optional) Relative (to the workspace) path of a groovy script to customize the ATH behaviour
.Step call example
[source,groovy]
----
runATH(metadataFile:"metadata.yml", athRevision: "master", athUrl:"https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness.git", jenkins: "2.110")
----


To make it usable in PR builders this step allows users to run the ATH using custom (typically previously built in the same Jenkinsfile) versions of any plugin, for that you need to set the metadata file's `useLocalSnapshots` property to true and stash the
plugins you want to use in the ATH run. By default you need to stash them with the name `localPlugins` the step will unstash them when appropriate and use the ATH`s `LOCAL_JARS` property to run the ATH. You can stash any number of plugins, all of
them will be used. You can also stash under other name by setting the env variable `RUN_ATH_LOCAL_PLUGINS_STASH_NAME`

.Using development versions of plugins

To make it usable in PR builders this step allows users to run the PCT using custom (typically previously built in the same Jenkinsfile) versions of any plugin, for that you need to set the metadata file's <i>useLocalSnapshots</i> property to true and stash the
     plugins you want to use in the PCT run. By default you need to stash them with the name<i>localPlugins</i> the step will unstash them when appropriate and use the PCT`s docker image <i>/pct/plugin-src</i> volume to access the sources. You can stash any number of plugins, all of
     them will be tested as long as they are specified in the metadata file. You can also stash under other name by setting the env variable <i>RUN_PCT_LOCAL_PLUGIN_SOURCES_STASH_NAME</i>
